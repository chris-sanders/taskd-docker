# TaskServer Docker image

TaskServer in a docker container for use with TaskWarrior with a few configurations exposed via environment variables.

You may want to consider using the 1.1.0-backports branch/image rather than this one as it contains some fixes for certificate expirations that the completely upstream 1.1.0 branch has not fixed.
